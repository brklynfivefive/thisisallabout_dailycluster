## Technical details
Automatically aggregates stories from major news publishers every hour. During this process, it filters out stop words. To analyze a large amount of news data, clustering unit first vectorizes all word tokens. Then, it automatically determine a reasonable and optimal size of clusters. Once the initial data processing is done, the "interpreter" unit creates a final result, ready to be published.
