mexico ninguno de los malhechores compareci ante la justicia seg n el comit de protecci n los periodistas ni de loco convertirse en estad stica dec mi mismo empezaba la era de obama se daba un poco de flexibilidad gracias al razonamiento de quienes dirig las pol ticas migratorias otros periodistas mexicanos tambi n llegaron los estados unidos buscando asilo como yo algunos con mucho xito pero mi caso se extendi hasta la presidencia de trump quien esclareci sus propias opiniones sobre los migrantes mexicanos desde el comienzo de su campa en julio del el juez neg mi petici n de asilo alegando que hab proporcionado suficiente evidencia como para comprobar que mi vida corr peligro al regresar mi abogado apel pero mientras esper bamos unos agentes de ice nos llevaron mi hijo durante un chequeo de rutina de ice ya nos llevaban la frontera cuando mi abogado pudo intervenir luego descubr que se trataba de una lista normalmente para fugitivos criminales pasamos los pr ximos siete meses

que hab formulado la corte de apelaciones en virginia para que el juez las reconsiderara sirvieron simplemente se perdieron varias p ginas del expediente despu el juez le dir nuestro abogado son tomadas en cuenta pero necesarias el presidente trump dice que har lo que sea para construir un muro que resguarde los estados unidos de personas como yo sigue insistiendo que la famosa caravana cuyos miembros buscaban asilo como yo estaba repleta de personas muy peligrosas incluso terroristas nosotros somos las personas las que hay que tenerle miedo los que dan miedo son los criminales de los
