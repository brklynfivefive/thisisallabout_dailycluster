furgoneta traslad hacia otro centro de detenci n en el paso en donde despu de pasar filtros de seguridad quedaba albergado en una barraca de un conjunto de mas de diez en donde se pueden hacinar hasta personas durante los dos largos meses en los que mi hijo estaba en el centro de detenci n para menores solo tuve la oportunidad de hablar con l por tel fono aproximadamente por minutos en total mi cuerpo se encog cuando lo escuchaba al otro lado de la l nea mas tarde llorar en mi cama despu de dos meses los mismos amigos de la virgencita que nos escondieron en su rancho en janos chihuahua para que los militares nos mataran le pidieron las autoridades migratorias que se les diera custodia de scar para que l pudiera comenzar el escolar fue que mi hijo ingreso la high school en las cruces nuevo xico la petici n fue concedida mi hijo fue liberado del centro de detenci n juvenil eso nos dio la oportunidad de hablar cada noche aunque todav pod visitarme en el paso despu de siete meses medio yo tambi n quede en libertad sin siquiera tener una respuesta al por qu de mi largo encierro ahora de mi libertad simplemente fui liberado pero n sometido una vigilancia constante que consist de una visita de un oficial mi domicilio en las cruces nuevo xico una visita las oficinas de ice una llamada por tel fono su antojo la prisi n se extendi la ciudad hubo que esperar meses para que se diera la oportunidad de obtener un permiso de trabajo mientras tanto viv expensas de nuestros amigos de janos del escaso dinero que obten de la venta de art culos de mi hogar en ascensi n que fueron presa de los ladrones lo mas triste era que ni siquiera se pod pensar en el retorno empezaba incrementarse el numero de periodistas asesinados entre el el docenas de periodistas fueron asesinados en mexico ninguno de los malhechores compareci ante la justicia seg n el comit de protecci n los periodistas ni de loco convertirse en estad stica dec mi mismo empezaba la era de obama se daba un poco de flexibilidad gracias al razonamiento de quienes dirig las pol ticas migratorias otros periodistas mexicanos tambi n llegaron los estados unidos buscando asilo como yo algunos con mucho xito pero mi caso se extendi hasta la presidencia de trump quien esclareci sus propias opiniones sobre los migrantes mexicanos desde el comienzo de su campa en julio del el juez neg mi petici n de asilo alegando que hab proporcionado suficiente evidencia como para comprobar que mi vida corr peligro al regresar mi abogado apel pero mientras esper bamos unos agentes de ice nos llevaron mi hijo durante un chequeo de rutina de ice ya nos llevaban la frontera cuando mi abogado pudo intervenir luego descubr que se trataba de una lista normalmente para fugitivos criminales pasamos los pr ximos siete meses

aparecer sobre las bombas improvisadas enviadas un adversario pol tico del presidente trump yo estaba en la corte de el paso por en sima vez en os para reiniciar un proceso de solicitud de asilo pol tico al juez simplemente le interes conocer ninguna evidencia que fueran en contra de lo que l al parecer ya hab dictado la deportaci n ni siquiera reconoc como periodista mexicano las recomendaciones que hab formulado la corte de apelaciones en virginia para que el juez las reconsiderara sirvieron simplemente se perdieron varias p ginas del expediente despu el juez le dir nuestro abogado son tomadas en cuenta pero necesarias el presidente trump dice que har lo que sea para construir un muro que resguarde los estados unidos de personas como yo sigue insistiendo que la famosa caravana cuyos miembros buscaban asilo como yo estaba repleta de personas muy peligrosas incluso terroristas nosotros somos las personas las que hay que tenerle miedo los que dan miedo son los criminales de los carteles los militares que matan los periodistas con impunidad hace apenas unas semanas fue asesinado alejandro rquez jim nez director de un peri dico de nayarit xico han conseguido al asesino es muy probable que su homicidio quede impune de acuerdo al cpj en el cuatro periodistas fueron asesinados por hacer su trabajo en plenas fiestas decembrinas una cava con la cabeza las manos de un hombre
