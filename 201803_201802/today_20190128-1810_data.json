simply care subject constitutional rights enforcement popular vote understand courts role consent decree protect people access political power lopez says used places prove local officials repeatedly systematically failed protect people marginalized groups failed political process taking decision making power away officials least decisions pertain constitutional policing precisely point furthermore local power argument particularly difficult apply sessions hardly principled advocate local control violated wishes local voters local officials suited priorities best example sessions threat withhold federal funding sanctuary cities despite fact police leaders cities say enforcing federal immigration law would make cities less safe data back interestingly sessions could taken similar approach police abuse could threatened withhold funding police agencies shown pattern abuse likely firmer legal ground went route immigration enforcement tells us something priorities sessions also fought throw consent decrees chicago baltimore even though local officials including heads cities police departments wanted may seem counterintuitive local officials welcome justice department scrutiny uncommon city elkhart ind also recently asked doj investigation propublica reported shockingly high rates misconduct police shootings also good reasons local leaders welcome federal oversight former seattle police chief norm stamper wrote book breaking rank mayors city managers local officials negotiate police contracts often faced limited budget often compensate benefits increased job

reactionary policing olson closes article arguing sessions orders modest paints common sense proposals aimed reining consent decrees outlived purpose speak orders apply policing seems clear orders make difficult justice department investigate oversee problematic police agencies example one order requires provisions consent decree must narrowly tailored remedy injury caused alleged legal violation strictly interpreted means justice department investigators would unable pursue tangential issues underlying causes may causing constitutional violations example ferguson police targeting black residents petty infractions driven dizzying predatory system municipalities st louis counties heavily incentivized supplement budgets revenue city courts revenue largely comes fines traffic violations petty crimes justice department investigators limited investigating violations fourth th amendments could well prevented ever delving role municipal courts think succeeded showing direct connection municipal courts police violating rights ferguson residents lopez says sessions memo spirit written would able address courts role confident current administration never would let chiraag bains co authored ferguson report agrees memo administration would never either investigation consent degree ferguson says problem limiting investigation agreement specific issue like shootings use police dogs get underlying culture systemic problems give rise issues departments need multi pronged approach without problems going crop soon leave another part sessions order requires consent decrees settlements approved senior department leadership olson characterizes effort stop underlings cutting consent decree deals without high level supervision supervision much putting ultimate decision consent decrees high level political appointees administration tend pretty adamantly opposed consent decrees one hand argument elections consequences president entitled put important policy decisions hands policymakers appoints counterargument constitutional rights beholden whims voters olson also complains inflexibility agreements currently enforced fair criticism sessions order actually makes difficult alter agreement place order significantly raises bar want modify existing agreement lopez says already really difficult would make nearly impossible result would strong incentive sue instead settle expensive federal government city one final particularly problematic part order somewhat paradoxically one way would make easier justice department pursue consent decrees restrictions relaxed consent decree would protect city third party lawsuit lopez explains let say doj knew aclu naacp file lawsuit city police department says know successful lawsuit would bring reforms someone like sessions thinks excessive burdensome police officers allows federal government hastily offer consent decree would essentially shield city third party lawsuit seem democratic either perhaps important question concerning consent decrees work evidence mixed post investigation made compelling case longer lasting agreements achieving much change lopez points addition fact examples investigation began critics also cited metrics may best way measure success give one example says often see people cite use force incidents way measure whether consent decree working one common problems see police departments failure report uses force one common reforms requirement force well documented punishment officers fail see use force incidents go consent decree particularly short term bains agrees think fair look longest lasting decrees cite say entire program working reason agreements lasted long tended least amount cooperation local officials police leaders one thing tried obama administration get input support local level politicians also civic groups activists makes huge difference bulk timeline early long lasting consent decrees also came george w bush administration like trump administration particularly friendly sort systemic reviews undertaken obama years recently three years seattle consent decree went effect public trust police rose percent percent importantly trust among blacks rose percent percent among latinos percent percent new orleans consent decree public trust police soared poll found percent residents thought city police culture improved since decree poll percent respondents said interaction new orleans police officer safe courteous percent felt safe homes city still high crime rate still dissatisfaction response times could attributed least part department shortage personnel lopez says metric public trust particularly among minority communities effective measure success way many variables affect use force incidents crime rates officer shootings says even surveys misleading think much valuable surveys community general marginalized communities police officers show community officer relations improved right track since new orleans nearly agreements shown improvement area trust means people willing cooperate police report help solve crimes also means appreciation police good morale even sessions insists morale takes temporary hit thought oversight paperwork criticism may city leaders places detroit east conn supporters consent decrees time agreements ended trump lose democratic administration could easily revoke

ridicule fact even people implementing acknowledged figuring go policy area justice department reports chicago ferguson baltimore cleveland new orleans cities documented systematic abuse jaw dropping
